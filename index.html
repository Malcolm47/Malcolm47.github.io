<h3>Masdoijfljdkfngk DIFKFERNETNT site</h3>

<!--
  cool project stuff:
  wxdarts
  dmvsnowday - try to get some pictures
  tornado archive - link to stuff you've written
  cswr - also include figures?
  maybe link to ths and anc websites, but this would be a smaller little portion
  also the umd dining thing

  more recent:
  Tuff! link to paper
  Micronet page! and umdwx front page!
  physics traffic waves project!

  I think what would be cooler than a list of stuff would be a sort of 'here's the projects i've done and the deliverables i've delivered'
  maybe just little widgets with images or image slideshow on a projects page/section
