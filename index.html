<h3>Masdoijfljdkfngk DIFKFERNETNT site</h3>

<!--
  cool project stuff:
  wxdarts - remember to grab good screenshots from the twitter
  THS? Not sure whether including this would be necessary. Was a pretty small thing. Same with ANC.
  Maybe when you're more established those experiences can go in an about me thing.
  dmvsnowday - try to get some pictures
  tornado archive - link to stuff you've written
  cswr - also include figures?
  maybe link to ths and anc websites, but this would be a smaller little portion
  also the umd dining thing

  more recent:
  Tuff! link to paper
  Micronet page! and umdwx front page!
  physics traffic waves project!

  I think what would be cooler than a list of stuff would be a sort of 'here's the projects i've done and the deliverables i've delivered'
  maybe just little widgets with images or image slideshow on a projects page/section

  Just be sure to include links to stuff - can clarify what's maintained and what's not

  also include links to linkedin and insta

  Include photos from AMS and SLS conferences!

  Also important - scale things physically based on their significance

  Include file of poster! Also on linkedin?

  try to get published in reputable journals... that's probably the biggest single thing grad schools want to see
